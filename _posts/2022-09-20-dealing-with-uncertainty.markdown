# What's going on?

In the recent months, we've been dealing with an abnormal amount of uncertainty. How do you deal when it seems like everything is up in the air? I'll share some of my thoughts and ideas here.  First, I'll cover some of _why_ we all feel this way.

# A global meltdown

- As if dealing with a global pandemic wasn't enough, [Russia declared war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine) on Ukraine, which sent the global markets and global supply chain into a spiral.
- [Inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021%E2%80%932022_inflation_surge) is on track to hit 10% for the year in U.S, a number that's being hit for the very first time in many places.
- Big tech is taking a big hit. [Coinbase](https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-exchange-coinbase-to-lay-off-18-of-staff-11655211069), [Snapchat](https://www.businessinsider.com/snaps-messy-layoffs-locked-workers-out-so-fast-they-couldnt-be-let-go-2022-9), and [Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk) are going through very, very tough times.
- In general, companies are taking a capitalistic approach to protecting the bottom line and profits. Several industries are rescinding offers, conducting layoffs, cutting on bonuses, and making taking time off more difficult.

# Don't resist

The best thing to do is to not resist what's happening. Don't try to force certainty out of the uncertain. This doesn't mean to just sit there and not take action, you should always strive to put your best foot forward. There is a diminishing return on trying to control what's out of your reach, however, and you should be aware of that. You're not going to be able to fix inflation, or bring stability back to the job market -- these are issues brought on by gradual movements chained together on a global scale. But you can take better care of yourself physically, emotionally and spiritually.

# Take care of yourself

It's easy to forget that you're your biggest investment. Taking care of yourself is paramount to navigating through periods like this one. A few suggestions that have helped me:

- Limit exposure to social media.
- Try and work out regularly. Hate the gym? Do a 30-minute walk, once a day.
- Feeling down? Reach out for mental health help. I used [Modern Health](https://modernhealth.com/), but there are also services like [BetterHelp](https://www.betterhelp.com/) that can help as well.

Don't feel bad or feel like you shouldn't tend to yourself. A lot of the anxiety that uncertainty brings also comes from the fact that we usually neglect ourselves during times like these. We become too preoccupied trying to steady the ship, and as a result forget to take care of ourselves.

# Engage in healthy activities

Do your best to stay away from overconsumption of drugs or alcohol. Sure, in the moment you'll feel fine, but they don't do much to help in the long run. Catch up with close friends and family -- just reaching out to those close to you can put you at ease. Watch a favorite show of yours, cook (or order) your favorite meal, or take yourself out on a date. When's the last time you truly enjoyed yourself? Taking a break will help to ease your stress.

# Actively control what you can

There's lots of things we can all stay accountable toward. Weekly meal prep, timely laundry, and journaling are a few things you can do. If you've been wanting to learn how to play an instrument, finish a certain book or podcast, or maybe a painting you've been working on -- take a small step toward accomplishing that. Developing a new skill takes one small step at a time, and before you know it, you've learned something new! Create a learning opportunity and reward yourself accordingly.

# Have confidence in yourself

Look back at your past successes. Did they not all come with a level of uncertainty? You've been in this same spot before. Maybe the circumstances were different, but at its core, the situation was the same. You didn't know what you didn't know. Have some confidence in yourself! You've navigated through murky waters and come out the other end just fine. This is an opportunity to once again prove that you can overcome, seize it!
