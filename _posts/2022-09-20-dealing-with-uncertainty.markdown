# What's going on?

In the recent months, we've been dealing with an abnormal amount of uncertainty. How do you deal when it seems like everything is up in the air? I'll share some of my thoughts and ideas here.  First, I'll cover some of _why_ we all feel this way.

# A global meltdown

- As if dealing with a global pandemic wasn't enough, [Russia declared war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine) on Ukraine, which sent the global markets and global supply chain into a spiral.
- [Inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021%E2%80%932022_inflation_surge) is on track to hit 10% for the year in U.S, a number that's being hit for the very first time in many places.
- Big tech is taking a big hit. [Coinbase](https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-exchange-coinbase-to-lay-off-18-of-staff-11655211069), [Snapchat](https://www.businessinsider.com/snaps-messy-layoffs-locked-workers-out-so-fast-they-couldnt-be-let-go-2022-9), and [Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk) are going through very, very tough times.
- In general, companies are protecting profits over people. Organizations are rescinding offers, conducting layoffs, and cutting on bonuses, just to name a few.

# Don't resist

Don't try to force certainty out of the uncertain. This doesn't mean to sit and not take action, you should always strive to put your best foot forward. There are certain things out of your reach, and you should be aware of that. You're not going to be able to fix inflation, or bring stability back to the job market. But what you can do is take better care of yourself physically, emotionally and spiritually.

# Take care of yourself

It's easy to forget that you're your biggest investment. Taking care of yourself is key to navigating through periods of uncertainty. A few suggestions that have helped me:

- Limiting exposure to social media.
- Working out regularly. Hate the gym? Do a 30-minute walk, once a day.
- Feeling down? Reach out for help. I used [Modern Health](https://modernhealth.com/), but there are also services like [BetterHelp](https://www.betterhelp.com/) out there.

Don't feel bad or feel like you shouldn't tend to yourself. A lot of the anxiety that uncertainty brings also stems from the fact that we usually neglect ourselves during times like these. We become too preoccupied trying to steady the ship, and as a result forget to take care of ourselves. Make sure you're okay before trying to fix everything around you.

# Engage in healthy activities

 Catch up with close friends and family -- reaching out to those close to you can put you at ease. Watch a favorite show of yours, cook (or order) your favorite meal, or take yourself out on a date. When's the last time you truly enjoyed yourself? Taking a break will help to ease your stress.

# Control what you can

![Someone writing in a journal](/images/journaling.jpg)

 Weekly meal prep, timely laundry, and journaling are a few things that can help us maintain control during uncertain times. If you've been wanting to learn how to play an instrument, finish a certain book or podcast, or maybe finish a painting you've been working on -- take a small step toward accomplishing that. Create a learning opportunity and reward yourself accordingly. 

# Have confidence in yourself

![Someone ripping a piece of paper saying they can't](/images/confidence-in-yourself.jpg)

Look back at your past successes. Did they not all come with a level of uncertainty? You've been in a similar spot before. You've navigated through tough situations before, and continued onward. This is an opportunity to once again prove that you can overcome, seize it!

# Moving forward

These times won't last forever. The markets will rebound, war will cease, and employment will become more stable. Take this time to identify with what's most important to you. Find opportunities to expand your skillset, and take some safe risks. Touch base with your family and friends, and remember to take care of yourself. Like everything, [this too shall pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_too_shall_pass).

Thanks so much for reading. As always, comments are welcome!
